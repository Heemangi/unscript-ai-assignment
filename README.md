# Drag and Drop Page Builder

## Overview

This web application enables users to create and customize web pages by dragging and dropping elements onto a canvas. It provides features such as element editing, keyboard shortcuts and local storage integration.

## Features

1. **Drag and Drop Functionality**: Users can drag elements from the sidebar and drop them onto the canvas to create their web page layout.

2. **Edit Modal**: Clicking on an element opens a modal where users can edit its properties, including text, position, font size, and font weight. Changes are saved upon clicking the "Save Changes" button.

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Keyboard shortcuts are available for quick actions. Pressing Enter allows users to edit the selected element, while pressing Delete deletes the selected element.

4. **Local Storage Integration**: Element data is stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to persist their work across sessions. This ensures that users can return to their projects and continue editing them later.
